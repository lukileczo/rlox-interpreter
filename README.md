# WIP: Implementing Lox Interpreter in Rust

This repository contains the work-in-progress implementation of a Lox interpreter in Rust, based on the
[*Crafting Interpreters* book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. This book provides a comprehensive
guide on building interpreters and covers various topics such as lexing, parsing, and evaluating expressions.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to learn the Rust programming language and build a fully functional Lox interpreter using Rust.

## Current Progress

At the moment, the project is still a work in progress. Chapter 4 is completed and the interpreter is able to tokenize
the expressions. The next step is to implement the parser and evaluator.
